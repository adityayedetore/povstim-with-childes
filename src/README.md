This directory contains the scripts I used to evaluate the CHILDES language model. 

You can use your `model.pt` or download our [pre-trained best model](http://adityayedetore.com/data/model.pt). 

To use these scripts, download our <a href="http://adityayedetore.com/data/CHILDES" download > vocabulary </a> (also a link to our training data).
