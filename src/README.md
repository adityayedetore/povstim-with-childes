This directory contains the scripts I used to evaluate the CHILDES language model. 

You can use your `model.pt` or download our [pre-trained best model](http://adityayedetore.com/data/model.pt). 

To use these scripts, download our [vocabulary](http://adityayedetore.com/data/CHILDES) (links also to training data).
